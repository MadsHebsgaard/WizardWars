For now each wizard chooses a spell to cast as well as target(s) on the same computer, one after the other.
You choose your action and the opponent(s) chooses their action(s).
When you both have choosen your actions, the turn happends and every action and event are shown.
Your stats are updated and you choose your next action untill everyone but the champion are dead.
Let the wisest Wizard win the war.
