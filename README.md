# WizardWars

WizardWars is all about anticipating and countering your opponent(s) spells.
First you choose number of players, then each player chooses his spells.
For now each player chooses a spell to cast on the same computer, one after the other.
You choose your action and the opponent(s) chooses their action(s).
When you both have choosen your actions, the turn happends and every action and event are shown.
Your stats are updated and you choose your next action untill everyone but the champion are dead.
Let the smartest Wizard reign supreme.
